* Time series plots

  * Time series plots have time in the x-axis and an outcome or
    measurement of interest on the y-axis.

  * [ ] Example: US ~fertility~ rates from 1960 to 2012.

    1) Filter the ~country~ ~United States~ out of ~gapminder~.
    2) Plot ~year~ vs. ~fertility~.

       #+name: ts1
       #+begin_src R :file ts1.png :exports both :session :results output graphics file

       #+end_src

  * [ ] Turn the plot into a line plot. Lines are easier to follow
    than scattered points.

    #+name: ts2
    #+begin_src R :file ts2.png :exports both :session :results output graphics file

    #+end_src

  * [ ] Let's look at two countries.

    1) Define a ~countries~ vector with ~South Korea~ and ~Germany~ in it.
    2) Filter both countries out of ~gapminder~
    3) Make a line plot of ~year~ vs. ~fertility~

    #+name: ts3
    #+begin_src R :file ts3.png :exports both :session :results output graphics file

    #+end_src

  * We haven't told ~ggplot~ anything about separating these data, so
    they're all connected by the same line.
