* README

  * Contains interactive notebooks and solution files. Download the
    files, open and edit/run them in GNU Emacs + ESS.

  * The notebooks themselves are also available for download on
    GDrive.

  * If you missed a class, you can run the notebook and submit it
    after adding your meta header to ascertain that you did the work
    (and not just copied the solutions file, which would be cheating).
