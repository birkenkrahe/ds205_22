* Org-mode coding assignment

  This file contains the first ~Org-mode~ assignment, a glossary of
  terms, and a sample solution in the programming language C instead
  of R. The main challenge is not the programming language but
  managing the complexity of writing a "literate" program, which
  includes layout, documentation, source code and result
  elements. Note that the sample solution also lists relevant
  references at the end.

** Assignment

   Create an Org-mode file with the following characteristics:

   1) A headline with the text ~My first Org-mode file~.
   2) A paragraph that explains what the following code block does.
   3) A R source code block. The block should contain one line of code
      only. It should have the name ~first_program~:
   #+begin_example
   #+name: first_program
   #+begin_src [header]
     [statements]
   #+end_src
   #+end_example
      
   4) For the source code block header, use the following arguments:
      #+begin_example
      :session *R*
      :results output
      :tangle first.R
      :exports both
      :comments both
      :var DATA="mtcars"
      #+end_example

   5) Inside the block, put the R statement:
      #+begin_example
       str(DATA)
      #+end_example

   6) Save the file as ~YourName.org~ (e.g. ~MarcusBirkenkrahe.org~)
   7) Upload the file to [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc100/tree/main/assignments/org-mode][this GitHub repo]]: ~birkenkrahe/ds205/assignments/org-mode~

*** Executing the program on the command line

    In Emacs (provided the C compiler ~gcc~ is available and in the ~PATH~):
    #+begin_example
    M-x eshell
    gcc -o first first.c
    #+end_example
