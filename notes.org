* What is this?

  Instead of bugging you with emails, I opt to summarize my course
  observations regarding content, process, in this file. These often
  contain additional links, articles, and musings.

  I usually update it after each class - it also contains the homework
  (if any). The first point of call for any questions should be the
  FAQ. There are two FAQs - a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#frequently-asked-questions][general one]] (for all my courses), and a
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc100/blob/main/FAQ.org][FAQ for CSC 100]].

* Week 1 - first session (Wed 12-Jan-2022)

*** Books

    None of which will be an exclusive, but I may use stuff from these
    books. They're all good in their own way but a little hard on
    one's own.

*** Regular expressions

    Important for efficient text mining and string manipulation,
    e.g. when doing data science on the command line, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression][regexp]] are
    search patterns. Here is a [[https://regexone.com/][complete, free, online tutorial]]
    (RegexOne, 2021), and here is a [[https://nostarch.com/download/automate2e_SampleCh7.pdf][free book chapter]] explaining
    regexp as part of automating stuff with Python (Sweigart, 2019).

    Examples for such regular expressions are the ~*~ in an SQL
    command like ~SELECT * FROM t~ to query all columns of the table
    ~t~, or ~^x~ that matches any string starting with ~x~ etc.

    #+caption: Perl problems (Source: xkcd).
    [[./img/perl.png]]

    ~Perl~ from the cartoon title, is another powerful language whose
    strength is pattern matching and manipulation. It's more high
    level than ~awk~ or ~sed~ though and lives on all operating
    systems.
    
*** ~awk~ (and ~sed~)

    This is an "awkward" language on GNU/Linux. They're natural
    languages for regexp use. Makes data wrangling on the command line
    reall easy. Not hard to learn, and we might take a look at it - I
    plan to present it in another class (operating systems) as part of
    the Linux layout. [[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/awk/index.htm][Here's a tutorial]] for ~awk~, and an opinion
    piece (Hughes, 2015). Something else for a rainy afternoon.

*** Getting started with GNU Emacs

    GNU Emacs is going to be our IDE and our environment for literate
    programming. This is an experiment that I'm running this term in
    all my courses - but this course (R) and the intro class on C/C++
    are the two classes where Emacs should really pay off.

    I suggested two short videos to get started while
    munching a bagel:
    * [[https://youtu.be/1YOrd7NCGkg][First Steps With Emacs]] (Eddelbuettel, 2021). This is especially
      for RStats people (like you), with a focus on ESS ('Emacs Speaks
      Statistics').
    * [[https://youtu.be/8HJGz3IYoHI][Literate programming demo]] (Birkenkrahe, 2022). Here I
      contrast Emacs Org-mode with an interactive shell using SQLite,
      an RDBMS.

    We'll get deeply into this soon as we set up our infrastructure.
    
*** Notebooks and notebook platforms

    There are many interactive notebooks and notebook platforms -
    they're especially popular in data science (and perhaps data
    science is so popular, and easier to learn because of them).

    Some examples: [[https://jupyter.org/][Jupyter]] (originally only for Python), Google
    [[https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index][Colaboratory]] (for Python and R - though with "magic" commands, one
    can use other languages, but it's not straightforward), and [[https://www.kaggle.com/][Kaggle]]
    (owned by Google). Kaggle serves notebooks, datasets and (most
    importantly) data science competitions (strong focus on machine
    learning). These are often quite ideological ("Save the whales
    with data science") but what isn't these days? Which is why data
    science needs strong bias monitoring[fn:1].

* Footnotes

[fn:1]Who wouldn't want to save the whales! Still, even a seeminly
harmless ideological thrust can lead to conflict. E.g. what if you
only have enough project budget to either save the whales or starving
children? That used to be a question for philosophy class - in data
science, it's everybody's task - because data science is decision
science.
