* Setting the path to R for Emacs

  If you cannot set the path to R using the ~PATH~ variable, you can
  give the explicit location of the R executable by putting this code
  into your ~.emacs~ file:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; set the path to R for ESS
  (setq inferior-ess-r-program "c:/Program Files/R/R-4.1.2/bin/R.exe")
  #+end_src
