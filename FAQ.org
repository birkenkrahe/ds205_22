* Setting the path to R for Emacs

  If you cannot set the path to R using the ~PATH~ variable (e.g. in
  the PC lab), you can give the explicit location of the R executable
  by putting this code into your ~.emacs~ file:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; set the path to R for ESS
  (setq inferior-ess-r-program "c:/Program Files/R/R-4.1.2/bin/R.exe")
  #+end_src

  However, on your personal computer, setting adding the absolute
  address to the folder with ~R.exe~ in it to the ~PATH~ variable will
  enable Emacs to find R. You can test this in the terminal with the command

  #+begin_example
  emacs -f R
  #+end_example

  For this to work, ~emacs~ must be in your ~PATH~, too - otherwise
  you have to type the path yourself like this:

  #+begin_example
  "c:\User\YourName\Program Files\GNU Emacs 27\bin\emacs"
  #+end_example
