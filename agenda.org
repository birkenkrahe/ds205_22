* README

  This file contains the agenda overview (what I had planned), the
  objectives (what we managed to do) and (much of the) content of each
  taught session of the course. I want to avoid splitting the content
  up over many files - so that you have to navigate as little as
  possible (like a book)!

  The companion file to this file, less structured and with the
  captain's log, is the [[file:notes.org][notes.org]] file.

   To identify yourself, use the ~#+AUTHOR:~ option. You can see how

   this works from the options in the header of this ~README.org~ file.

   There is no upper or lower limit on the number of words. The main
   point is to create a proper Org-mode file.

  We will hold a special lab session tomorrow, Monday 31 January
  3-3.50 PM, to sort out any issues related to Emacs and R. Bring your
  own PC to the session, or work on a lab desktop. I will spend the
  time going round to make sure that you can

  * Install/ open / use the Emacs editor
  * Create, run and tangle Org-mode files with R code
  * Install / use the R programming language
  * Understand the recent program assignments

    The necessary steps are also demonstrated [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwgb17bzeNygo8GU6SivwwjsQj9QabqAJ][in this tutorial video
    playlist]].

  We will continue with our regular program on Wednesday, 2nd February
  at 3 PM - a short quiz will be available before.
